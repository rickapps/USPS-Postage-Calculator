# USPS-Postage-Calculator

This .NET class library handles all communications with the US Postal Service web API to obtain postage rates. Your application only needs to instantiate the USPSRateCalculator class included in this library and call the methods on that class to obtain postage rates. 

To instantiate the class, you will need a user id from the United States Postal Service. You can obtain one for free from this website: http://www.usps.com/webtools/.
